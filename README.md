PO-User-Scripts
===============
Repository that I'll (hopefully) fill with more UserScripts for Pok√©mon Online's client side scripting.

Feel free to take whatever's here and make pull requests/make suggestions etc

Installing
-------------
1. Click Plugins from the PO menu at the top and check if "Script Window" is there, if it is skip to 5, otherwise move to 2
2. Click "Plugin Manager" and then "Add Plugin"
3. It should open up the "My Plugins" folder, find "ClientScripting.dll" and double click it
4. Repeat step 1
5. Click "Script Window"
6. Copy the script you want into this window (make sure to use the raw files by click "raw"!)
7. Then just click ok!

Notes
-------------
It's possible to combine multiple scripts together, but unless you know what you're doing, ask for help before attempting. 

"Merged Script.js" already has all the current scripts merged together

Any issues/bugs report to Crystal Moogle or post them in the Scripting Sub-Forum on the PO forums

Currently requires PO version 2.0.05 (Which as of writing is the latest). Versions that work on older clients are available in the "Legacy Folder".
